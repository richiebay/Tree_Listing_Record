The tree listing record catalogue GUI allows users to keep track of trees and make new entries, it allows them to select officers responsible, Species of the tree, growth environment, height category, health classes, DBH, diameter of canopy , longitude and latitude measurements.
The GUI is implemented using PySimple GUI which is a very powerful python library used for designing and implementing databases in a very simple and intuitive way, the interface is divided into rows and columns and are filled accordingly, it provides very power documentation and demos that allows users to design their softwares very quickly, so I believe it was the most convenient option.
